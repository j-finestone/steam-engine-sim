# steam-engine-sim
This project is a simulation used to demonstrate basic engines of a steam engine. It works via fluid simulation, which pushes a piston

The purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of physics, learn how to generate fluid simulations, increase understanding of applying math, and practice building systems without rellying on a prebuilt engine.

FEATURES
-Particles that colide with eachother, barrier blocks, and pistons
-particals that increase push strength to simulate an increase in pressure when heated 
-colored particles to help demonstratre the heat
-A system of dials to control the exact specs of th simulation

Log of prossess
-Original orgonazation plan wasnt working so I decided to develope an object higherarchy systems with components more similar to Unity


TECHNOLOGIES
-Javascript
-HTML5 Canvas
-No external physics libraries
